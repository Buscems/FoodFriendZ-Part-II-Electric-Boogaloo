Before you edit the UI, you should be aware of these things...

1. The Canvas is set to [Scale to Screen Size]
2. The resolution is set to 1600 x 900 (16:9)
3. Lock your [Game Veiw] window at 16: 9 Aspect Ratio
4. Pixel Perfect is enabled
5. All Scripts using TextMeshPro have "using.TMPro"
6. UI elements have [Preserve Sprite Aspects] enabled
